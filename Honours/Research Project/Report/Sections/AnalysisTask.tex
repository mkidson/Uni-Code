Writing an analysis task in O2 is structured quite strictly, due to it needing to be run by O2. We will outline the steps needed to go from reconstructed data to histograms of, in our case, kinematic variables. It must be noted that learning how to do this, and how to deal with the idiosyncrasies of the O2 software, were what took up the majority of the time spent on this project. It is written to do one thing very very well, but unfortunately that comes with the side-effect of it being extremely picky about the conditions in which the software will actually work.
