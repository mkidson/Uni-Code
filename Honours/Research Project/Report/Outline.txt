Intro
- Introduces ALICE Run 3 & ITS, MFT, O2
- Outline intent of project: learning how to use O2 and how data goes from detector to analysis

Theory/Background
- Coordinates fine
- More about ALICE and what the report is relevant to
- Bigger ITS, MFT, O2 sections about the path of data from detector to AOD
    - Reconstruction passes

Analysing
- How to use O2
    - Writing tasks
    - Compiling
- The intent of the analysis
- Details of the analysis
- Why comparison isn't possible (sigh)

Results
- Plots (pretty)
- Explanations
- ITS
- Comparison of pass3 and pass4 MFT

Conclusion?
