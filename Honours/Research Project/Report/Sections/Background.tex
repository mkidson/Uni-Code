The ALICE detector (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a detector experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Its primary goal is the investigation of ``strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities, where a formation of a new phase of matter, the quark-gluon plasma, is expected'' (\cite{ALICE_LOI}). It achieves this goal by studying the products of head-on collisions of heavy ions such as lead.
