    We investigate pilot-beam data from proton-proton collisions in Run 3 at ALICE, checking if the new Muon Forward Tracker, Inner Tracking System, and Online-Offline analysis framework are working as intended.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
Run 3 is the latest period of data capture at the LHC, with an intended centre of mass energy per collision of $\sqrt{s}=\SI{13.6}{\tera\electronvolt}$ and increased luminosity of collisions---a factor 10 increase in integrated luminosity for Pb-Pb collisions. For Run 3, ALICE is moving from a triggered readout system to a combination of triggered and continuous readout. In order to achieve this, many detectors and their front-end electronics were upgraded, some new detectors were added, and the analysis framework was overhauled entirely. 

The Inner Tracking System (ITS) was upgraded with an entirely new pixel detector technology, hoping to greatly increase the resolution when determining the primary collision vertex. The Muon Forward Tracker (MFT) is one of the new detectors added. Its primary use is to assist the Muon Spectrometer (MCH) with vertexing and tracking in the forward region of ALICE and was developed with the same technology as the ITS. To deal with the increased volumes of data, a new analysis framework was introduced called Online-Offline (O2).

This report aims to use O2 to have a ``look-see'' at data coming from the ITS and MFT to see if the detector and analysis tools are working correctly. The data used in this investigation is from two proton-proton collision runs performed in October 2021, at a centre-of-mass energy of \SI{900}{\giga\electronvolt}. This is not an energy we expect to use for physics data analysis but is good enough for this purpose.
