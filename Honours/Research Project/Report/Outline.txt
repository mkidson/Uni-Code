Intro
- Introduces ALICE Run 3 & ITS, MFT, O2
- Outline intent of project: learning how to use O2 and how data goes from detector to analysis

Theory/Background
- Coordinates fine
- More about ALICE and what the report is relevant to
- Bigger ITS, MFT, O2 sections about the path of data from detector to AOD
    - Reconstruction passes

Analysing
- How to use O2
    - Writing tasks
    - Compiling
- The intent of the analysis
- Details of the analysis
- Why comparison isn't possible (sigh)

Results
- Plots (pretty)
- Explanations
- ITS
- Comparison of pass3 and pass4 MFT

Conclusion?

In terms of looking forward, there are some things that can be done to get a better picture of the detector performance. Firstly we could look at simulations to compare distributions. We could also compare new to old techniques for tracking and vertexing when looking at the same data, so for example doing vertexing with the MCH and the MFT and comparing.
