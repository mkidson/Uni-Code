    We investigate pilot-beam data from proton-proton collisions in Run 3 at ALICE, tracing its journey through two of the new detectors (the Inner Tracking System and Muon Forward Tracker) and the new Online-Offline analysis framework.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
The ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) detector is a detector experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Its primary goal is the investigation of ``strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities, where a formation of a new phase of matter, the quark-gluon plasma, is expected''~\cite{ALICE_LOI}. It achieves this goal by studying the products of head-on collisions of heavy ions such as lead, called Pb-Pb collisions for short. It also studies proton-lead (p-Pb) and proton-proton (p-p) collisions. 

Run 3 is the latest period of data capture at the LHC, with an intended centre of mass energy per collision of $\sqrt{s}=\SI{13.6}{\tera\electronvolt}$ and increased luminosity of collisions---a factor 10 increase in integrated luminosity for Pb-Pb collisions. For Run 3, ALICE is moving from a triggered readout system to a combination of triggered and continuous readout. In order to achieve this, many detectors and their front-end electronics were upgraded, some new detectors were added, and the analysis framework was overhauled entirely. 

Of the upgrades to ALICE, the following are the subject of this report. The Inner Tracking System (ITS) was upgraded with an entirely new pixel detector technology, hoping to greatly increase the resolution when determining the primary collision vertex. The Muon Forward Tracker (MFT) is one of the new detectors added. Its primary use is to assist the Muon Spectrometer (MCH) with vertexing and tracking in the forward region of ALICE and uses the same technology as the ITS. To deal with the increased volumes of data, a new analysis framework was introduced called Online-Offline (O2). 

This report aims to introduce the detectors and how they output data, trace the path of that data through the new analysis framework until it arrives at our desk, and show the details of the analysis we performed on it. The data used in this report is from two proton-proton collision runs performed in October 2021, at a centre-of-mass energy of \SI{900}{\giga\electronvolt}. This is not an energy we expect to use for physics data analysis but is good enough for this purpose.
