    We investigate pilot-beam data from proton-proton collisions in Run 3 at ALICE, tracing its journey through two of the new detectors (the Inner Tracking System and Muon Forward Tracker) and the new Online-Offline analysis framework. The data is analysed to assess the performance of the detectors with the expectation of isotropic emission of particles, taking their geometry into account. Recommendations for improvements to the analysis framework and documentation are given.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
The ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) detector is a detector experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Its primary goal is the investigation of ``strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities, where a formation of a new phase of matter, the quark-gluon plasma, is expected''~\cite{ALICE_LOI}. It achieves this goal by studying the products of head-on collisions of heavy ions such as lead, called Pb-Pb collisions for short. It also studies proton-lead (p-Pb) and proton-proton (p-p) collisions. 

Run 3 is the latest period of data capture at the LHC, with an intended centre of mass energy per collision of $\sqrt{s}=\SI{13.6}{\tera\electronvolt}$ and increased luminosity of collisions---a factor 10 increase in integrated luminosity for Pb-Pb collisions. For Run 3, ALICE is moving from a triggered read-out system to a combination of triggered and continuous read-out. In order to achieve this, many detectors and their front-end electronics were upgraded, some new detectors were added, and the analysis framework was overhauled entirely. 

Of the upgrades to ALICE, the following are the subject of this report. The Inner Tracking System (ITS) was upgraded with an entirely new pixel detector technology, hoping to greatly increase the resolution when determining the primary collision vertex. The Muon Forward Tracker (MFT) is one of the new detectors added. Its primary use is to assist the Muon Spectrometer (MCH) with vertexing and tracking in the forward region of ALICE and uses the same technology as the ITS. To deal with the increased volumes of data, a new analysis framework was introduced called Online-Offline (O2, pronounced "Oh-squared"). 

This report aims to introduce the detectors and the data they output, trace the path of that data through the new analysis framework until it arrives at our desk, and show the details of the analysis we performed to determine if the upgrades are working as expected. The data used in this report is from two proton-proton collision runs performed in October 2021, at a centre-of-mass energy of \SI{900}{\giga\electronvolt}. This is not an energy we expect to use for physics data analysis but is good enough for this purpose.

\section{Discussion and Recommendations}\label{sec:DiscussionRecommendations}
Our methods of analysis for the most part came down to interpreting histograms of kinematic variables through the lens of assumed isotropic emission of particles. The shape of the coordinate system and detector geometry had to be considered in order to explain some things and there was a lot of guesswork as to the configuration of the detectors and reconstruction process/analysis framework. In this section we present some improvements that can be made to this process.

There were many times during our analysis where we came up against a limitation in the analysis software that restricted our ability to see the details we were after. This really comes down to the fact that the types of analysis that O2 was (and still is being) built for are not the type that we were looking to do. Given more time to attain a greater understanding of the inner workings of particularly the steps from CTFs to AODs, we might have been able to delve into the belly of the beast and find the data ourselves. Since we were limited by our time this year, the best we can do is recommend some modifications to the AOD data model that would lend themselves to these analyses. 

We recommend introducing more detail about the tracks in the MFT, such as the position of hits in each disk, or even a simple ``Cluster Map''-style column in the \texttt{aod::MFTTracks} table to be able to see which disks or detector planes contributed to the track. At time of writing, there is no way to view the vertex position data as determined by the ITS or the MFT alone. Adding this capability would allow for an investigation into the improvement of the new ITS and MFT in that sector, which we were unable to do.

Outside the realm of modifying O2 and the data model, there is more that could be done to properly verify if the distributions we see for, say $\eta$ and $\varphi$, are correct. We have attempted to explain them from a physical motivation but comparison to simulated data would prove the most robust way to check that there are no large systematic errors. In the interest of determining how the MFT has improved the tracking capabilities in the forward region, the old techniques used in Runs 1 and 2 using the MCH could be implemented on new data and compared to the new technique on the same data. This would require investigation of the analysis framework at a much more involved level than was possible in this report but could lead to some interesting results. Once again simulation could aid in this endeavour. 

Lastly, we were left with many questions about the details of the track reconstruction, read-out architecture, and columns in the data model such as the $z$ variable in \texttt{aod::MFTTracks}. This effectively comes down to the documentation surrounding these detectors and analysis framework, so a concerted effort to improve that documentation would be greatly appreciated by people new to the ALICE group and to these detectors. 

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:Conclusion}
The advent of Run 3 at the LHC, with its increased energy and luminosity, brought a number of new challenges that required the ALICE detectors and analysis framework to be upgraded. Among the detector upgrades were two new silicon tracking detectors; the ITS and MFT. In this report we used the new O2 analysis framework to look at distributions of variables relating to particle tracks in either the ITS or MFT, using pilot beam data from October 2021. The intention was both to learn the new framework and to determine if the new detectors are performing as expected.

Before any analysis could be done, the new framework had to be learned. Due to its need to be efficient and lightweight on hard disk and memory usage, it is very particular about how things must be structured. Learning O2 took up the majority of the time spent on this project and the basics are presented in \cref{sec:AnalysingWithO2}. 

Simulation of data for comparison was outside the scope of this project so the notion of an ``expected performance'' had to come from an understanding of the physical design of the detectors as well as an interpretation of the read-out architecture and track reconstruction process as outlined in the Technical Design Reports of the two detectors. Isotropic emission of particles from the IP was assumed which led to expectations of smooth, if not uniform, distributions in most cases. Where this was not seen and the geometry of the sensitive material of the detectors couldn't explain the discrepancy, specific areas of research into the detectors were recommended. This analysis is presented in \cref{sec:OurAnalysis}.

Due to time limitations, this report could only give a qualitative review of the performance of the new detectors so we present recommendations for the direction of further investigation in \cref{sec:DiscussionRecommendations} if a more quantitative perspective is desired.

Using the assumption of isotropic emission of particles from IP as a baseline, we interpreted histograms of kinematic variables through the lens of the geometry of the sensitive material of the detectors as well as the geometry of the coordinates commonly used in particle physics. This led to expectations of smooth distributions in most cases
