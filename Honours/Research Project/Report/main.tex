\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
The ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) detector is a detector experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Its primary goal is the investigation of ``strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities, where a formation of a new phase of matter, the quark-gluon plasma, is expected''~\cite{ALICE_LOI}. It achieves this goal by studying the products of head-on collisions of heavy ions such as lead, called Pb-Pb collisions for short. It also studies proton-lead (p-Pb) and proton-proton (p-p) collisions. 

Run 3 is the latest period of data capture at the LHC, with an intended centre of mass energy per collision of $\sqrt{s}=\SI{13.6}{\tera\electronvolt}$ and increased luminosity of collisions---a factor 10 increase in integrated luminosity for Pb-Pb collisions. For Run 3, ALICE is moving from a triggered read-out system to a combination of triggered and continuous read-out. In order to achieve this, many detectors and their front-end electronics were upgraded, some new detectors were added, and the analysis framework was overhauled entirely. 

Of the upgrades to ALICE, the following are the subject of this report. The Inner Tracking System (ITS) was upgraded with an entirely new pixel detector technology, hoping to greatly increase the resolution when determining the primary collision vertex. The Muon Forward Tracker (MFT) is one of the new detectors added. Its primary use is to assist the Muon Spectrometer (MCH) with vertexing and tracking in the forward region of ALICE and uses the same technology as the ITS. To deal with the increased volumes of data, a new analysis framework was introduced called Online-Offline (O2). 

This report aims to introduce the detectors and the data they output, trace the path of that data through the new analysis framework until it arrives at our desk, and show the details of the analysis we performed on it. The data used in this report is from two proton-proton collision runs performed in October 2021, at a centre-of-mass energy of \SI{900}{\giga\electronvolt}. This is not an energy we expect to use for physics data analysis but is good enough for this purpose.

\section{Discussion and Recommendations}


There were many times during our analysis where we came up against a limitation in the analysis software that restricted our ability to see the details we were after. This really comes down to the fact that the types of analysis that O2 was (and still is being) built for are not the type that we were looking to do. Given more time to attain a greater understanding of the inner workings of particularly the steps from CTFs to AODs, we might have been able to delve into the belly of the beast and find the data ourselves. Since we were limited by our time this year, the best we can do is recommend some modifications to the AOD data model that would lend themselves to these analyses. 

Firstly we recommend introducing more detail about the tracks in the MFT, such as the position of hits in each disk, or even a simple ``Cluster Map''-style column in the \texttt{aod::MFTTracks} table to be able to see which disks or detector planes contributed to the track. At the present moment there is no way to view the vertex position data as determined by the ITS or the MFT alone. Adding this capability would allow for a much deeper investigation into the improvement of the new ITS and MFT in that sector than we were able to do.

Outside the realm of modifying O2 and the data model, there is more that could be done to properly verify if the distributions we see for, say $\eta$ and $\varphi$, are correct. We have attempted to explain them from a physical motivation but comparison to simulated data would prove the most robust way to check if there are no large systematic errors. In the interest of determining how the MFT has improved the tracking capabilities in the forward region, the old techniques used in Runs 1 and 2 using the MCH could be implemented on new data and compared to the new technique on the same data. This would again require investigation at a much more involved level than was possible in this report but could lead to some interesting results. Once again simulation could aid in this endeavour. 

Lastly, we were left with many questions about the details of the track reconstruction, read-out architecture, and columns in the data model such as the $z$ variable in \texttt{aod::MFTTracks}. This effectively comes down to the documentation surrounding these detectors and analysis framework, so a concerted effort to improve that documentation would be greatly appreciated by people new to the ALICE group and to these detectors.
